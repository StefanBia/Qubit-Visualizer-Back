## About the Project

After taking the TUCN course on the basics of quantum computing, I have decided to create a way to facilitate the entry into the world of qubits, thus creating the Qubit Visualizer. I chose to make a Web Application to ensure widespread accessibility and visibility, allowing a broader audience to explore its features. My program of choice was Spring, with which I was being familiar and which is one of the most used frameworks for building web applications.

## Getting Started

The application allows for diverse requests from the client part of the application: CRUD for every table in the database as well as a login request. More functionalities are to be implemented.

### Prerequisites

Being in development, the user needs to have an IDE for running a Spring application like
IntelliJ or Eclipse. Postman is also recommended for making requests.
### Installation

Clone the project from the GitHub repository. Open the application in your editor of choice and press the RUN button. The application will run on the localhost on port 8080 and will be ready for requests. 

## Usage

This Web Application was created with a sole educational purpose, being a friendly way of approaching a tough subject, without dealing with the tough math behind it.

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions, as well as improvement suggestions.


## Acknowledgements

I have to give credit to the TUCN for teaching me this subject, as well as the [Uranium](https://uranium.transilvania-quantum.org/)  platform and the [Quantum Odyssey](https://www.quarksinteractive.com/)  video game for being the inspiration of my work.
